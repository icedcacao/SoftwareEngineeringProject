# The needs and challenges of secondary school teachers on faculty management system:

Interviewer: Hello, and thanks again for your time to do this interview. We are developing a faculty scheduling system and hope to understand the requirements and the challenges you encountered when using the existing system.

Raymond: No problem, I am happy to help.

# The use of existing system:

Interviewer: What faculty management system are you currently using? How was your overall experience with it?

Raymond: Our school is currently using E-Class. It is mainly used for course scheduling, attendance records and grade management. Most functions work pretty well, but some parts are not convenient to use, especially the scheduling part.

# System functional requirements:

Interviewer: What functions do you think an ideal faculty management system should have?

Raymond: The system should be able to generate a course schedule automatically and allow us to adjust it manually. Like quickly finding the appropriate time and classroom that is available if I need to adjust my class due to special circumstances.
I want the system to be recording student’s attendance automatically also so I don’t have to do it manually.
The system should also support different grading methods, like the weight between homework and examination.
A notification system would be also, like sending notifications about course changes and meeting reminders.
Able to check all this information on my phone would definitely be a cherry on top.

# Difficulties in using existing systems:

Interviewer: Are there any difficulties or challenges you encountered when using the existing system?

Raymond: It often conflicts when 2 classes are scheduled at the same time or the room is being booked twice. This ends up needing us to make adjustments manually and takes a lot of time.
There are also too many buttons, so I sometimes get lost in them.
If I want a class to be fixed at a specific time, the system can’t do it.

# Expectation for new system:

Interviewer: What are your expectations or suggestions for the new system?

Raymond: Having a simple and clear interface is definitely going to help. Data safety is also important. Having full mobile support is really convenient. And it will be really good if the system can be adjusted to individual needs.
